          The Poolesville Math Tournament (PVMT) is ran by dedicated Poolesville
          High School students from the Poolesville Math Team. We invite middle
          school students of all backgrounds and skill levels to participate!
        </p>
        <div class="linebreak-2"></div>
        <p>
          This contest is open to all 6th-9th graders in the country. Note that all members on a team must be
          in the same division.
        </p>
        <div class="linebreak-2"></div>
        <p>
          Students will compete in teams of at most 4 people. Smaller teams (of
          1, 2, and 3 people) are also allowed, but note that these teams will
          be at a disadvantage for the team rounds because they have fewer
          people. There is no limit to how many teams a particular
          school/organization may register.
