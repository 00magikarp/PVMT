          The Poolesville Math Tournament (PVMT) is ran by dedicated Poolesville
          High School students from the Poolesville Math Team. We invite middle
          school students of all backgrounds and skill levels to participate!
        </p>
        <div class="linebreak-2"></div>
        <p>
          The contest will have two divisions, 1 and 2, so that competitors'
          skill levels are well matched. Division 2 is meant for students who
          are relatively new to competition math and don't have much experience
          with the Mathcounts/AMC competitions. Division 1 is meant for those
          who are familiar with contest math, and will thus have harder
          problems. Please choose your division appropriately based on your
          skill level; it is highly discouraged for experienced students to
          purposely choose Division 2. Note that all members on a team must be
          in the same division.
        </p>
        <div class="linebreak-2"></div>
        <p>
          Students will compete in teams of at most 4 people. Smaller teams (of
          1, 2, and 3 people) are also allowed, but note that these teams will
          be at a disadvantage for the team rounds because they have fewer
          people. There is no limit to how many teams a particular
          school/organization may register.

          Competitors from both divisions will take two subject tests, an
          individual round, a team round, and a gust round. The four subject
          tests available are Algebra, Geometry, Number Theory, and
          Combinatorics, and each subject test will be 45 minutes and consist of
          8 problems. The individual round is 60 minutes and will consist of 15
          problems; the team round is 45 minutes and consists of 20 problems.
